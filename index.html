            Put simply, bioinformatics is the science of storing, retrieving and analysing large amounts of 
            biological information. It is a highly interdisciplinary field involving many different types of 
            specialists, including biologists, molecular life scientists, computer scientists and mathematicians.

            The term bioinformatics was coined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper to describe “the study of
            informatic processes in biotic systems” and it found early use when the first biological sequence
            data began to be shared. Whilst the initial analysis methods are still fundamental to many 
            large-scale experiments in the molecular life sciences, nowadays bioinformatics is considered 
            to be a much broader discipline, encompassing modelling and image analysis in addition to the 
            classical methods used for comparison of linear sequences or three-dimensional structures.
